#4. Create a game where the computer picks a random word and
#the player has to guess that word. The computer tells the
#player how many letters are in the word. Then the player gets
#five chances to ask if a letter is in the word. The computer can
#only respond with “yes” or “no”. Then, the player must guess
#the word.
